# User Management 

- User id

0 is reserved for root user

1 - 999 for system user

1000 - above is for other user


/etc/passwd - contains username, home directory

/etc/shadow - contains password hash

# create user using adduser or useradd command

adduser moh1

password - ***

fill in all other info's or leave blank


- check user id and password

grep "username" /etc/passwd

grep "username" /etc/shadow

passwd "username"


# create group  

- check which groups user belongs

groups "username"


- add user to sudo group

usermod -aG sudo "username"


- delete a user (from root)

userdel "username"

# Linux permissions

# Group permissions

- owner = o

- group = g

- all = a

- create a directory and go there

mkdir permissions

cd permissions

ls -l

it has permissions like -rw-r--r--

    "-" denotes the type (file/directory/link)

    - check it

    ls -ld 

    now in place of "-" you see "d"


    "rw-" for USER and permissions are read and write

    "r--" for GROUPS and permissions is read only

    "r--" for OTHERS and permissions is read only

# Change permissions for user

    - Giving user execute permission

    chmod u+x "fileORdirName"


    - check it

    ls -l "fileORdirName"


    - Giving gruop write access

    chmod g+w "fileORdirName"

    - check it

    ls -l "fileORdirName"


    - Giving others execute permission on the file

    chmod o+x "fileORdirName"


# Remove a permission

    - To remove a permission use chmod u/g/o-r/w/x


    - Remove execute permission from user

    chmod u-x "fileORdirName"

    - Remove write permission from group

    chmod g-w "fileORdirName"


    - Remove read permission from other

    chmod o-r "fileORdirName"


    - Remove read permission from ALL

    chmod a-r "fileORdirName"


# Permission using Octal mode  
    
    "r" = 4

    "w" = 2

    "x" = 1

    - chmod 777 "fileORdirName" means permission of user - 7, group - 7, other - 7 

    "7" = r + w + x (4 + 2 + 1)

    "6" = r + w (4 + 2)

    "5" = r + x (4 + 1)

    ...
