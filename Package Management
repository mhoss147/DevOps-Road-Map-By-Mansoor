# What is a package?

    - It is a way of distributing applications; it may contains
    binaries, configuration files, documents; basically an application
    packaged into one file.


    - Redhat use .rpm and Debian uses .deb package  

    - When we install package it is coming from - /etc/apt/sources.list

    cat /etc/apt/sources.list

 # Install a steam locomotive (animation)

    
    - Create a Folder named packages

    mkdir packages

    cd packages

    - Downloading SL package for debian

    wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/sl/sl_3.03-17_amd64.deb

    - Install that package using tool- dpkg

    sudo dpkg -i sl_3.03-17_amd64.deb (packageName)

    - Check It

    sl

    - Show all the package installed 

    sudo dpkg -l


    - Filter out with grep

    sudo dpkg -l | grep sl
    

    - Filter out with grep + word with sl

    sudo dpkg -l | grep -w sl


 # Install a steam locomotive (animation) using apt

    - First of all run update to resynchronize

    sudo apt-get update


    - Install the package (without http)

    sudo apt-get install sl


    - Check It

    sl

# Remove a package

   - Remove a package using 'remove or purge'

   sudo apt-get remove (remove everything except config files)

   sudo apt-get purge (remove everything)
    
    
    
    - Install nginx 
    // nginx is a web server, runs as a service 
    // nginx can only run as static web server (by default)

    sudo apt-get install nginx

    - Remove nginx

    sudo apt-get remove nginx


    - Check if removed everything? No

   sudo dpkg -l | grep nginx


   - To get rid og them 

   sudo apt-get autoremove

   // Static web server can be a blog (html, css, js), all will see same, browser handle the code/logic

   // Dynamic web server can be of any complexity, functions like login, comments, complicated to hostname, have serverside connected


   // Service is a software that provides a 'service' and 'listens' for requests 

   // If a service runs in the background it is called 'Daemon'

   // Not all services are 'Daemon' and not all Daemon are 'services'

# Manage nginx server using systemctl
   
   // systemctl - Control the systemd system and service manager

   - Install nginx

   sudo apt-get install nginx

   - See name of the services system started/stopped

   sudo systemctl --type=service


   - See the name of the services running
   // see nginx is running...

   sudo systemctl --type=service --state=running

   - Start/stop... service using systemctl

   sudo systemctl start "serviceName" / sudo systemctl start nginx

   sudo systemctl stop "serviceName" / sudo systemctl stop nginx

   sudo systemctl status "serviceName" / sudo systemctl status nginx

   sudo systemctl enable "serviceName"

   sudo systemctl disable "serviceName"


# Checking if our web server is working

   - See all the running processes

   ps aux

   // VSZ = virtual memory, RSS = actual memory

   - Find the specific process is running ot Not

   ps aux | grep nginx (nginx is the serviceName)

// you will see nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on

   - Kill a process

   sudo kill 1269 (1269 is the PID - processID)

   or
//using the -9 switch ensures that the process is effectively killed. Even though a frozen or unresponsive process may not respond to a simple TERM signal, it will die when sent a KILL signal.

   sudo kill -9 1269 (1269 is the PID - processID)
