# What is a package?

    - It is a way of distributing applications; it may contains
    binaries, configuration files, documents; basically an application
    packaged into one file.


    - Redhat use .rpm and Debian uses .deb package  

    - When we install package it is coming from - /etc/apt/sources.list

    cat /etc/apt/sources.list
