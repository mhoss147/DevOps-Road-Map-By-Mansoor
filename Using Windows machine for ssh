# Using Windows machine for ssh


- in Windows search box type "poweshell" > select Run as administrator > confirm

- type ssh in PowerShell window

you will see

usage: ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface]


- to connect to your Linux machine, we need IP address

login to your virtual machine 

then type 

    ip a


you will 2 ip addresses which means our virtual machine does not have access to host network

to access this virtual machine from our local machine, you need to enable something called "Bridged network" 

to do that shut down the virtual machine

in virtualbox click on the settings > select Network > in Attached to select "Bridged adapter" > if you are connected to ethernet choose that adapter/

if connected via wifi choose that adapter

Restart the VM again


then type 

    ip a
    
- in PowerShell or cmd find your local machine IP

    ipconfig


check ipv4 address here compare VM both ip 

one the ip show the same network


- now in windows powershell use ssh

ssh username@IPaddress (ip of same network)


if you are connecting first time, accept the fingerprint


    yes


give the password of that user of VM

you are connected!



- check by running ls in both machines


ls


- connecting remote server by using ssh not always good, BETTER is ssh key based authentication


- create ssh key 


ssh-keygen


file will be saved in   /home/moh/.ssh/id_rsa


if you already have a key it will be overwritten


Overwrite (y/n)?


Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):     (if somebody able to get the private key, they will not be able to use it without passphrase)


enter

key created



- see the private key

cat /home/moh/.ssh/id_rsa


private key always stays in local machine, if you have access to this key you can have access to any server where this key is used for access!

so you should always use a passphrase with it!


- see the public key

cat /home/moh/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


public key is sent to the remote server
